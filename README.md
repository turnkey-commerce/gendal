# About gendal

`gendal` is a command-line tool to generate [Go](https://golang.org/project/)
code based on a database schema or a custom query. It is based on a fork of the [xo](https://github.com/xo/xo) repository.

`gendal` works by using database metadata and SQL introspection queries to discover
the types and relationships contained within a schema, and applying a standard
set of base (or customized) Go templates against the discovered relationships.

Currently, `gendal` can generate types for tables, enums, stored procedures, and
custom SQL queries for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server,
CockroachDB, and SQLite3 databases.

**NOTE:** While the code generated by gendal is production quality, it is not the
goal, nor the intention for gendal to be a "silver bullet," nor to completely
eliminate the manual authoring of SQL / Go code.

## Database Feature Support

The following is a matrix of the feature support for each database:

|              | PostgreSQL       | MySQL            | Oracle           | Microsoft SQL Server| SQLite           | CockroachDB      |

## Installation

Install `goimports` dependency (if not already installed):

```sh
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
```

Then, install in the usual Go way:

```sh
$ go get -u github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal

# install with oracle support (see notes below)
$ go get -tags oracle -u github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal
```

**_NOTE:_** Go 1.11+ is needed for installing `gendal` from source, as it makes use
of the trim template syntax in Go templates, which is not compatible with
previous versions of Go. However, code generated by `gendal` should compile with Go
1.3+.

## Quickstart

The following is a quick overview of using `gendal` on the command-line:

```sh
# change to project directory
$ cd $GOPATH/src/path/to/project

# make an output directory
$ mkdir -p models

# generate code for a postgres schema
$ gendal pgsql://user:pass@host/dbname -o models

# generate code for a Microsoft SQL schema using a custom template directory (see notes below)
$ mkdir -p mssqlmodels
$ gendal mysql://user:pass@host/dbname -o mssqlmodels --template-path /path/to/custom/templates

# generate code for a custom SQL query for postgres
$ gendal pgsql://user:pass@host/dbname -N -M -B -T AuthorResult -o models/ << ENDSQL
SELECT
  a.name::varchar AS name,
  b.type::integer AS my_type
FROM authors a
  INNER JOIN authortypes b ON a.id = b.author_id
WHERE
  a.id = %%authorID int%%
LIMIT %%limit int%%
ENDSQL

# build generated code
$ go build ./models/
$ go build ./mssqlmodels/

# do standard go install
$ go install ./models/
$ go install ./mssqlmodels/
```

## Using a Configuration File

A more consistent and repeatable way to run `gendal` throughout the life of a project is to use a configuration file.  A base configuration file called [gendal.toml](gendal.toml) is provided which uses the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) language for providing configurable access to all of the command line options.

Follow these steps to use the configuration file:

1) Copy the gendal.toml file from the gendal repository to the root directory of your project.
2) Edit the `DSN` setting to point to the database for your project.
3) Edit other settings according to the the needs of your project.
4) Run gendal without needing to pass any command line flags.

```sh
$ gendal
```

If any command line options are passed then they will override the setting provided in the configuration file.

## About Base Templates

`gendal` provides a set of generic "base" [templates](templates/) for each of the
supported databases, but it is understood these templates are not suitable for
every organization or every schema out there. As such, you can author your own
custom templates, or modify the base templates available in the `gendal` source
tree, and use those with `gendal` by a passing a directory path via the `--template-path`
flag.

For non-trivial schemas, custom templates are the most practical, common, and
best way to use `gendal` (see below quickstart and related example).

### Custom Template Quickstart

The following is a quick overview of copying the base templates contained in
the `gendal` project's [`templates/`](templates) directory, editing to suit, and
using with `gendal`:

```sh
# change to working project directory
$ cd $GOPATH/src/path/to/my/project

# create a template directory
$ mkdir -p templates

# copy gendal templates for postgres
$ cp "$GOPATH/src/github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal/templates/*" templates/

# remove gendal binary data
$ rm templates/*.go

# edit base postgres templates
$ vi templates/postgres.*.tpl.go

# use with gendal
$ gendal pgsql://user:pass@host/db -o models --template-path templates
```

See the Custom Template example below for more information on adapting the base
templates in the `gendal` source tree for use within your own project.

### Storing Project Templates

Ideally, the custom templates for your project/schema should be stored
within your project, and used in conjunction with a build pipeline such as
`go generate`:

```sh
# add to custom gendal command to go generate:
$ tee -a gen.go << ENDGO
package mypackage

//go:generate gendal pgsql://user:pass@host/db -o models --template-path templates
ENDGO

# run go generate
$ go generate

# add custom templates and gen.go to project
$ git add templates gen.go && git commit -m 'Adding custom gendal templates for models'
```

Note that `gendal` only needs the templates for your specific database. You can
safely delete the templates for the other databases -- make sure, however, that
your templates are not symlinks to another database's templates before
deleting.

### Template Language/Syntax

`gendal` templates are standard Go text templates. Please see the [documentation
for Go's standard `text/template` package](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/)
for information concerning the syntax, logic, and variable use within Go
templates.

### Template Context and File Layout

The contexts (ie, the `.` identifier in templates) made available to custom
templates are instances of `gendal/internal/$TYPE` (see below table on `$TYPE`
available `$TYPE`s), and are defined in [`internal/types.go`](internal/types.go).

Each database, `$DBNAME`, has its own set of templates for `$TYPE` and are
available in the [templates/](templates/) directory as `templates/$DBNAME.$TYPE.go.tpl`:

| Template File                         | `$TYPE`      | Description                                           |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `templates/$DBNAME.type.go.tpl`       | `Type`       | Template for schema tables/views/queries              |
| `templates/$DBNAME.enum.go.tpl`       | `Enum`       | Template for schema enum definitions                  |
| `templates/$DBNAME.proc.go.tpl`       | `Proc`       | Template for stored procedures/functions ("routines") |
| `templates/$DBNAME.foreignkey.go.tpl` | `ForeignKey` | Template for foreign keys relationships               |
| `templates/$DBNAME.index.go.tpl`      | `Index`      | Template for schema indexes                           |
| `templates/$DBNAME.querytype.go.tpl`  | `QueryType`  | Template for a custom query's generated type          |
| `templates/$DBNAME.query.go.tpl`      | `Query`      | Template for custom query execution                   |
| `templates/xo_db.go.tpl`              | `ArgType`    | Package level template generated once per package     |
| `templates/xo_package.go.tpl`         | `ArgType`    | File header template generated once per file          |

For example, PostgreSQL has [`templates/postgres.foreignkey.go.tpl`](templates/postgres.foreignkey.go.tpl)
which defines the template used by `gendal` for PostgreSQL's foreign keys. This
template will be called once for every foreign key relationship that `gendal` finds
in a PostgreSQL schema, and each time the template will be passed a different
`internal.ForeignKey` instance, populated fields for `Name`, `Schema`, etc.,
which are then available in the `templates/postgres.foreignkey.go.tpl` as
template variables, and used similar to the following: `{{ .Name }}`, `{{ .Schema }}`,
etc.

Since some of the templates are identical for the supported databases, the
templates are not duplicated, but are instead symlinks in the `gendal` source tree.
For example, [`templates/oracle.querytype.go.tpl`](templates/oracle.querytype.go.tpl)
is a symlink to [`templates/postgres.querytype.go.tpl`](`templates/postgres.querytype.go.tpl`).

#### Template Helpers

There is a set of well defined template helpers in [`internal/funcs.go`](internal/funcs.go)
that can assist with writing templated Go code / SQL. Please review how the
base [`templates/`](templates/) make use of helpers, and/or see the inline
documentation for the respective helper func definitions.

#### Packing Templates

The base `gendal` templates are bin packed so that they are always available to the
built `gendal` binary using [`go-bindata`](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) (via
the [`tpl.sh`](tpl.sh) script) and need to be regenerated/included in any
changeset when submitting any template changes to the `gendal` project.

If you would like to distribute your own binary version of `gendal` with the
included templates, simply modify the templates in the `gendal` source tree, run
`tpl.sh`, and build as you normally would.

Alternatively, you can simply do the following:

```sh
$ go generate && go build
```

## Customizing Generated Types
It is possible to override the types in the generated code by adding a section
called `TypeOverrides` in `gendal.toml`. This bypasses all the type generation
logic and simply maps the database types with the custom go type. To customize
a type, add a table to the `TypeOverrides` array in the configuration file:
```toml
[[TypeOverrides]]
DatabaseType = "database type name"
Type_ = "go_type"
NilValue = "go_nil_value"
NullableType = "nullable_go_type"
NullableNilValue = "nullable_go_nil_value"
```
Where:
* `database_type_name` is the SQL type name (case insensitive);
* `go_type` is the go type name when the SQL type is declared with a `NON NULL`
constraint;
* `go_nil_value` is an expression declaring a default value of that type;
* `nullable_go_type` is the go type name when the SQL type is declared
_without_ a `NON NULL` constraint;
* `nullable_go_nil_value` is an expression declaring a default `nil` value of that
type;

> This function is only available using the configuration file.

## Examples

### Example: End-to-End

Please see the [booktest example](examples/booktest) for a full end-to-end
example for each supported database, showcasing how to use a database schema
with `gendal`, and the resulting code generated by `gendal`.

Additionally, please see the [pokedex example](examples/pokedex) for a
demonstration of running `gendal` against a large schema. Please note that this
example is a work in progress, and does not yet work properly with Microsoft
SQL Server and Oracle databases, and has no documentation (for now) -- however
it works very similarly to the booktest end-to-end example.

### Example: Ignoring Fields

Sometimes you may wish to have the database manage the values of columns
instead of having them managed by code generated by `gendal`. As such, when you
need `gendal` to ignore fields for a database schema, you can use the `--ignore-fields`
flag. For example, a common use case is to define a table with `created_at`
and/or `modified_at` timestamps, where the database is responsible for setting
column values on `INSERT` and `UPDATE`, respectively.

Consider the following PostgreSQL schema where a `users` table has a
`created_at` and `modified_at` field, where `created_at` has a default value of
`now()` and where `modified_at` is updated by a trigger on `UPDATE`:

```PLpgSQL
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL DEFAULT '' UNIQUE,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  modified_at timestamptz default now(),
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_modified_column() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.modfified_at = now();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_users_modtime BEFORE UPDATE ON users FROM EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_modified_column();
```

We can ensure that these columns are managed by PostgreSQL and not by the Go
code generated with `gendal` by passing the `--ignore-fields` option:

```sh
# ignore special fields
$ gendal pgsql://user:pass@host/db -o models --ignore-fields created_at modified_at
```

### Example: Custom Template -- adding a `GetMostRecent` lookup for all tables

Often, a schema has a common layout/pattern, such as every table having a
`created_at` and `modified_at` field (as in the PostgreSQL schema in the
previous example). It is then a common use-case to have a `GetMostRecent`
lookup for each table type, retrieving the most recently modified rows for each
table (up to some limit, N).

To accomplish this with `gendal`, we will need to create our own set of custom
templates, and then add a `GetMostRecent` lookup to the `$DBTYPE.type.go.tpl`
template.

First, we create a copy of the base `gendal` templates:

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/path/to/project

$ mkdir -p templates

$ cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal/templates/* templates/
```

We can now modify the templates to suit our specific schema, adding lookups,
helpers, or anything else necessary for our schema.

To add a `GetMostRecent` lookup, we edit our copy of the `postgres.type.go.tpl`
template:

```sh
$ vi templates/postgres.type.go.tpl
```

And add the following templated `GetMostRecent` func at the end of the file:

```go
// GetMostRecent{{ .Name }} returns n most recent rows from '{{ .Schema }}.{{ .Table.TableName }}',
// ordered by "created_at" in descending order.
func GetMostRecent{{ .Name }}(db XODB, n int) ([]*{{ .Name }}, error) {
    const sqlstr = `SELECT ` +
        `{{ colnames .Fields "created_at" "modified_at" }}` +
        `FROM {{ $table }} ` +
        `ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT $1`

    q, err := db.Query(sqlstr, n)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer q.Close()

    // load results
    var res []*{{ .Name }}
    for q.Next() {
        {{ $short }} := {{ .Name }}{}

        // scan
        err = q.Scan({{ fieldnames .Fields (print "&" $short) }})
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }

        res = append(res, &{{ $short }})
    }

    return res, nil
}
```

We can then use the templates in conjunction with `gendal` to generate our "model"
code:

```sh
$ gendal pgsql://user:pass@localhost/dbname -o models --template-path templates/
```

There will now be a `GetMostRecentUsers` func defined in `models/user.gendal.go`,
which can be used as follows:

```go
db, err := dburl.Open("pgsql//user:pass@localhost/dbname")
if err != nil { /* ... */ }

// retrieve 15 most recent items
mostRecentUsers, err := models.GetMostRecentUsers(db, 15)
if err != nil { /* ... */ }
for _, user := range users {
    log.Printf("got user: %+v", user)
}
```

### Example: Overriding Types
Overriding types gives the developer full control over the go types
generated from a database schema.

For example, the `--int32-type` flag allows to override the go type for 32 bits
integer to any type from the default `int`. However, with PostgreSQL for
instance, if an `INTEGER` column does not have a `NOT NULL` constraint. The
resulting go type will be `sql.NullINt64`.

Overriding types allows to fully map a 32 bits integer to a specific go
type. In the example above a PostgreSQL `INTEGER` could be mapped to `int32`
and `*int32` for columns without a `NOT NULL` constraint.

Overriding types also allows the mapping of complex (and/or custom)
database types to custom go types, such as custom structs.

As a practical example, `SMALLINT` could be using a pointer for nullable
values:
```toml
[[TypeOverrides]]
DatabaseType = "SMALLINT"
Type_ = "int16"
NilValue = "0"
NullableType = "*int16"
NullableNilValue = "nil"
```

To use a go `string` and `*string` (with `NULL` values) for PostgreSQL's `TEXT`,
one can define:

```toml
[[TypeOverrides]]
DatabaseType = "TEXT"
Type_ = "string"
NilValue = '""'
NullableType = "*string"
NullableNilValue = "nil"
```

> Note that the `NilValue` is `'""'` and not just `""`, as it is an
> *expression*. Thus `'""'` will result in a go empty string literal (`""`),
> while an actual empty string in the config file would result in *nothing* in
> the generated go code.

Array types can also be overriden. For example to take advantage of `pgtype`'s
array types. For example:

```toml
[[TypeOverrides]]
DatabaseType = "TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE[]"
Type_ = "pgtype.TimestamptzArray"
NilValue = "pgtype.TimestamptzArray{}"
NullableType = "pgtype.TimestamptzArray"
NullableNilValue = "pgtype.TimestamptzArray{}"

[[TypeOverrides]]
DatabaseType = "TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE[]"
Type_ = "pgtype.TimestampArray"
NilValue = "pgtype.TimestampArray{}"
NullableType = "pgtype.TimestampArray"
NullableNilValue = "pgtype.TimestampArray{}"
```

will use `pgtype.TimestamptzArray{}`/`pgtype.TimestampArray{}` for an array of
timestamp rather than a slice of `pgtype.Timestamptz`/`pgtype.Timestamp`.

## Using SQL Drivers

Please note that the base `gendal` templates do not import any SQL drivers. It is
left for the user of `gendal`'s generated code to import the actual drivers. For
reference, these are the expected drivers to use with the code generated by
`gendal`:

| Database (driver)            | Package                                                                      |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Additionally, please see below for usage notes on specific SQL database
drivers.

### MySQL (mysql)

If your schema or custom query contains table or column names that need to be
escaped using any of the `--escape-*` options, you must pass the `sql_mode=ansi`
option to the MySQL driver:

```sh
$ gendal --escape-all 'mysql://user:pass@host/?parseTime=true&sql_mode=ansi' -o models
```

And when opening a database connection:

```go
db, err := dburl.Open("mysql://user:pass@host/?parseTime=true&sql_mode=ansi")
```

Additionally, when working with date/time column types in MySQL, one should
pass the `parseTime=true` option to the MySQL driver:

```sh
$ gendal 'mysql://user:pass@host/dbname?parseTime=true' -o models
```

And when opening a database connection:

```go
db, err := dburl.Open("mysql://user:pass@host/dbname?parseTime=true")
```

### Oracle (ora)

Oracle support is disabled by default as the [Go Oracle driver](https://github.com/rana/ora)
used by `gendal` needs the Oracle `instantclient` libs to be installed/known by
`pkg-config`. If you have already [installed rana's Oracle driver](https://github.com/rana/ora#installation)
according to the installation instructions, you can simply pass `-tags oracle`
to `go get`, `go install` or `go build` to enable Oracle support:

```sh
$ go get -tags oracle -u github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal
```

#### Installing Oracle instantclient on Debian/Ubuntu

On Ubuntu/Debian, you may download the instantclient RPMs
[here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html).

You should then be able to do the following:

```sh
# install alien, if not already installed
$ sudo aptitude install alien

# install the instantclient RPMs
$ sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient-12.1-basic-*.rpm
$ sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient-12.1-devel-*.rpm
$ sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient-12.1-sqlplus-*.rpm

# get gendal
$ go get -u github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal

# copy oci8.pc from gendal/contrib to system pkg-config directory
$ sudo cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal/contrib/oci8.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/

# install rana's ora driver
$ go get -u gopkg.in/rana/ora.v4

# assuming the above succeeded, install gendal with oracle support enabled
$ go install -tags oracle github.com/turnkey-commerce/gendal
```

#### Contrib Scripts and Oracle Docker Image

It's of note that there are additional scripts available in the
[contrib](contrib/) directory that can help when working with Oracle databases
and `gendal`.

For reference, the `gendal` developers use the [sath89/oracle-12c](https://hub.docker.com/r/sath89/oracle-12c/) Docker image
for testing `gendal`'s Oracle database support.

### CockroachDB (postgres)
CockroachDB is a distributed SQL database that is basically wire-compatible with Postgres with exceptions in the supported features. The compatibility does allow to use the standard pg driver in Go.

If the database is named something other than 'public' it is necessary to provide the database name as the schema via the `-s name` argument when using `gendal`:

```sh
$ gendal cr://cr_user@localhost:26257/crdb?sslmode=disable -s crdb -o models
```
Note: The `sslmode=disable` is for development only and not for production.

### SQLite3 (sqlite3)

While not required, one should specify the `loc=auto` option when using `gendal`
with a SQLite3 database:

```sh
$ gendal 'file:mydatabase.sqlite3?loc=auto' -o models
```

And when opening a database connection:

```go
db, err := dburl.Open("file:mydatabase.sqlite3?loc=auto")
```

### About the `pgx` Driver for Postgres and the `pg-type` Flag

As for the other drivers, `gendal` does not import or use them. However, `pgx`
is a special case as it will perform better or have more features using the
types from the `pgtype` module. To use `pgx` to its fullest, the `pg-type`
argument lets `gendal` know to generate code that uses those types instead of
the default ones.

The supported modes for the `pg-type` flag are:
* `std` is the default mode. It will generate code using the types
from the `sql/database` module.
* `pgtype-full` will generate code using types from the `pgtype` module
for every fields and arguments. This mode lets `pgx` use `pgtype` to
its fullest but the models can look a bit less clean as each field is
a wrapped type.
* `pointer` will generate code using the types internal to the
`pgtype` structures. For nullable fields and arguments, this type will
be a pointer to that type. If the internal type of the struct cannot be
used because the struct contains several fields, the equivalent from
the `std` mode is used instead.
* `pgtype` is the same as `pointer` except that it will use the `pgtype`
structures for nullable fields and arguments rather than pointers.

## About Primary Keys
For row inserts `gendal` determines whether the primary key is
automatically generated by the DB or must be provided by the application for the table row being inserted.
For example a table that has a primary key that is also a foreign key to another table, or a
table that has multiple primary keys in a many-to-many link table, it is desired that
the application provide the primary key(s) for the insert rather than the DB.

`gendal` will query the schema to determine if the database provides an automatic primary key
and if the table does not provide one then it will require that the application provide the
primary key for the object passed to the the Insert method. Below is information on how
the logic works for each database type to determine if the DB automatically provides the PK.

### MySQL Auto PK Logic
* Checks for an autoincrement row in the information_schema for the table in question.

### PostgreSQL Auto PK Logic
* Checks for a sequence that is owned by the table in question.

### CockroachDB Auto PK Logic
* Checks for table with a column with a constraint that is named 'primary'.
* Checks that the column in question has a default value of 'unique_rowid()'.

### SQLite Auto PK Logic
* Checks the SQL that is used to generate the table contains
the *AUTOINCREMENT* keyword.
* Checks that the table was created with the primary key type of *INTEGER*.

If either of the above conditions are satisfied then the PK is determined to be automatically provided
by the DB. For the case of integer PK's when you want to override that the PK be manually provided
then you can define the key type as *INT* instead of *INTEGER*, for example as in the following many-to-many
link table:

```sql
  CREATE TABLE "SiteContacts" (
  "ContactId"	INT NOT NULL,
  "SiteId"	INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY(ContactId,SiteId),
  FOREIGN KEY("ContactId") REFERENCES "Contacts" ( "ContactId" ),
  FOREIGN KEY("SiteId") REFERENCES "Sites" ( "SiteId" )
)
```

### SQL Server Auto PK Logic
* Checks for an identity associated with one of the columns for the table in question.

### Oracle Auto PK Logic
There is currently no method provided for Oracle as there is no programmatic way to query
for which sequences are associated with tables. All PK's will be assumed to be provided
by the database.

## PostgreSQL JSON/JSONB support
* User set an option EnablePostgresJson=true in config (or --enable-postgres-json=true
in command line).
* Gendal generates not Json/Jsonb type for field, but type with same name as field.
* Then user defines this type with SQL interface functions: Scan and Value.
* User can define UnmarshalJSON/MarshalJSON for this struct and simply call then in Scan and Value.
* Also user can override generated type name to some predefined type with UnmarshalJSON/MarshalJSON
and simply add Scan and Value.

# Design, Origin, Philosophy, and History

`gendal` can likely get you 99% "of the way there" on medium or large database
schemas and 100% of the way there for small or trivial database schemas. In
short, gendal is a great launching point for developing standardized packages for
standard database abstractions/relationships, and gendal's most common use-case is
indeed in a code generation pipeline, ala `stringer`.

### Design

`gendal` is **NOT** designed to be an ORM or to generate an ORM. Instead, `gendal` is
designed to vastly reduce the overhead/redundancy of (re-)writing types and
funcs for common database queries/relationships in Go -- it is not meant to be
a "silver bullet".

### History

The [xo](https://github.com/xo/xo) project was originally developed while migrating a large application written in
PHP to Go. The schema in use in the original app, while well designed, had
become inconsistent over multiple iterations/generations, mainly due to
different naming styles adopted by various developers/database admins over the
preceding years. Additionally, some components had been written in different
languages (Ruby, Java) and had also accumulated significant drift from the
original application and accompanying schema. Simultaneously, a large amount of
growth meant that the PHP/Ruby code could no longer efficiently serve the
traffic volumes.

In late 2014/early 2015, a decision was made to unify and strip out certain
backend services and to fully isolate the API from the original application,
allowing the various components to instead speak to a common API layer instead
of directly to the database, and to build that service layer in Go.

However, unraveling the old PHP/Ruby/Java code became a large headache, as the
code, the database, and the API, all had significant drift -- thus, underlying
function names, fields, and API methods no longer coincided with the actual
database schema, and were named differently in each language. As such, after a
round of standardizing names, dropping cruft, and adding a small number of
relationship changes to the schema, the various codebases were fixed to match
the schema changes. After that was determined to be a success, the next target
was to rewrite the backend services in Go.

In order to keep a similar and consistent workflow for the developers, the
previous code generator (written in PHP and Twig templates) was modified to
generate Go code. Additionally, at this time, but tangential to the story, the
API definitions were ported from JSON to Protobuf to make use of its code
generation abilities as well.

`gendal` is based on the open source version of that code generation tool, and is the fruits
of those development efforts. It is hoped that others will be able to use and
expand `gendal` to support other databases -- SQL or otherwise -- and that `gendal` can
become a common tool in any Go developer's toolbox.

### Goals

Part of `gendal`'s goals is to avoid writing an ORM, or an ORM-like in Go, and to
instead generate static, type-safe, fast, and idiomatic Go code across
languages and databases. Additionally, the `gendal` developers are of the opinion
that relational databases should have proper, well-designed relationships and
all the related definitions should reside within the database schema itself:
ie, a "self-documenting" schema. `gendal` is an end to that pursuit.
